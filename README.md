Project: Mini E-Learning Platform
Description:
This is a simple front-end prototype for an e-learning platform. It includes:
- A homepage listing courses
- A course detail page showing lessons and progress
- A “mark as completed” button for each lesson
The design is minimal, clean, and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.
Course data is stored in a JavaScript array and progress is saved in localStorage.
